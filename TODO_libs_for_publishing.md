## Priority

- Find a way to keep track of the previous dev versions without is being overwritten by non stable releases.
- Make a script for dev versions.

## Other
- Open files (with text editor command defaulting to `idea`)

- Get new version string based on last version(s) and channel(s)
- Update version in README (check side-effects are almost impossible)
