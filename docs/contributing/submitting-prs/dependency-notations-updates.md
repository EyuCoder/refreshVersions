# Submitting dependency notations updates

Thanks for considering an update to the built-in dependency notations in refreshVersions!

However, we are in the process of refactoring the way we define dependency notations in refreshVersions,
so it's less overhead for both you and us, and less error-prone to do overall (especially regarding backwards and forward compatibility).

That means that **we're unlikely to accept any submission** of dependency notation updates **for now**.

To be informed when that refactoring is complete, you can subscribe to this issue: {{link.issues}}/275
